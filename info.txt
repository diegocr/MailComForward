HOW WORK:

Mail.comForward  work as a browser, with a little diference...  it login in
every time you press the 'Go' button, this is for avoid the autologout sent
by Mail.com when the cookie change...

The  process  is  very  simple...   when  you press 'Go' MFWD login to your
account,  open  your Inbox folder, check for an email and if one found open
another  connection  for download the mail, then connect to the smtp server
and  forward  it  to  your  forward email address, when this is done, other
connection  is  open  for  move the mail to the TRASH folder, then continue
checking for new mail...

More simplified:

1.- Connect/login
2.- Open Inbox/Check
3.- Receive email
4.- Forward email
5.- Delete email
6.- jump to step 2 while new mail found
7.- Thats all! :)


TIPS:

Go to your mail.com preferences account, and do:

"Mail header display" to 'show basic' (In newer version I try to include all headers)
"..Messages per page" to a highter number, f.ex. 100

doing this you gain a considerable speed...
