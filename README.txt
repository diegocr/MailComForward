This program used to be a mail.com forwarder (ie, WWW -> POP), basically
like what is now widely know as IMAP...sort of

It was developed at the year 2002/2003 using the AREXX (Amiga's REXX)
programming/scripting language. Also I have to note at that time i was
both learning to code and English.. so if you want to have some laughs
try to read those texts.
